I DID NOT CREATE THE WHOLE CODE.


////////////////////////////////////

You work for Global Rain, a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development. As a junior software developer, you are part of a software development team at Global Rain that collaborates to create software solutions for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies around the world.

You have been newly assigned to a development team at Global Rain. This team is currently working on a project for an innovative international search and rescue animal training company, Grazioso Salvare. Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that will help track search and rescue animals, sometimes referred to as rescue animals. These rescue animals are obtained and trained by the company to rescue humans from difficult (or even life-threatening) situations.

A portion of the work on this project has already been done. Your team lead has assigned you to create one new class and modify the existing driver class in the software application. You will deliver all the class files to the team lead, who will consolidate them with the work from other team members and present the application to your client.

Directions
Your team lead has given you a specification document detailing Grazioso Salvare’s software needs. Other members of the Global Rain development team have already started creating the RescueAnimal.java, Dog.java, and Driver.java class files. Your team lead has asked you to modify the existing Driver.java class and create a Monkey.java class as your contribution to the team.

Required Pre-work

To gain a clear understanding of the client’s requirements, review the Grazioso Salvare Specification Document, located in the Supporting Materials section. As you read, pay close attention to the attributes and methods that you will need to implement into the program.
Open the Virtual Lab by clicking on the link in the Virtual Lab Access module. Then open the Eclipse IDE. Follow the Uploading Files to Eclipse Tutorial to upload the Grazioso.zip files into Eclipse. Both the tutorial and the zipped folder are located in the Supporting Materials section. The Grazioso.zip folder contains three class files. Once you upload the files, compile the code. Although the program is not complete, it should compile without error.
Read through the code for each class that you have been given. This will help you understand what code has been created and what code must be modified or created to meet the requirements.
Once you have completed the pre-work, you are ready to begin your assigned tasks.

Monkey.java Class

Your team lead reminded you to demonstrate industry standard best practices in all of your code to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency among all software developers working on the program. In your code for each class, be sure to include the following:
In-line comments that denote your changes and briefly describe the functionality of each method or element of the class
Appropriate variable and method naming conventions
In a new Java file, create the Monkey class, using the specification document as a guide. The Monkey class must do the following:
Inherit from the RescueAnimal class
Implement all attributes to meet the specifications
Include a constructor. You may use a default constructor. To score “exemplary” on this criterion, you must include the more detailed constructor that initializes values for all attributes. Refer to the constructor in the Dog class for an example.
Include accessors and mutators for all implemented attributes
Driver.java Class

In this class, you will modify and implement several different methods. You will need to refer back to the code from the other classes to properly implement these methods.

As a reminder, you must demonstrate industry standard best practices, such as in-line comments to denote changes and describe functionality and appropriate naming conventions throughout the code that you create or modify for this class.
First, you will modify the main() method. In main(), you must create a menu loop that does the following:
Displays the menu by calling the displayMenu() method. This method is in the Driver.java class.
Prompts the user for input
Includes input validation. If the user inputs a value not on the menu, the program should print an error message.
Takes the appropriate action based on the value that the user entered.
IMPORTANT: In the Module Five milestone, you were asked to create a menu loop but were not required to include input validation. Be sure to include input validation for your Project Two submission.
Next, you will complete the intakeNewDog() method. Your completed method should do the following:
Prompt the user for input
Include input validation. Note: The required input validation has already been included in the starter code; be sure to review it.
Set data for all attributes based on user input
Add the newly instantiated dog to an ArrayList
Hint: Remember to refer to the accessors and mutators in the Dog and RescueAnimal classes as you create this method.
Next, you will implement the intakeNewMonkey() method. Before you do this, you will need to create a monkey ArrayList in the Driver.java class. Refer to the dog ArrayList for an example. Then, begin implementing the intakeNewMonkey() method. Your completed method should do the following:
Prompt the user for input
Include input validation for the monkey’s name and species type. If the user enters an invalid option, the program should print an error message.
Set data for all attributes based on user input
Add the newly instantiated monkey to an ArrayList
Hint: Remember to refer to the accessors and mutators in your Monkey and RescueAnimal classes as you create this method.
IMPORTANT: In the Module Five milestone, you began implementing this method but were not required to include input validation. Be sure to include input validation for your Project Two submission.
Next, you will implement the reserveAnimal() method. Your completed method should do the following:
Prompt the user for input. The user should enter their desired animal type and country.
If there is an available animal which meets the user’s input criteria, the method should access an animal object from an ArrayList. If there are multiple animals that meet these criteria, the program should access the first animal in the ArrayList. The method should also update the “reserved” attribute of the accessed animal.
If there is not an available animal which meets the user’s input criteria, the method should output feedback to the user letting them know that no animals of that type and location are available.
Finally, you have been asked to implement a printAnimals() method that provides easy-to-read output displaying the details of objects in an ArrayList.
To demonstrate this criterion in a “proficient” way, your implemented method must successfully print the ArrayList of dogs or the ArrayList of monkeys.
To demonstrate this criterion in an “exemplary” way, your implemented method must successfully print a list of all animals that are “in service” and “available”.
